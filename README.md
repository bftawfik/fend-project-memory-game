## Instructions

This Project is a project from the udacity nanodegree program for front-end developers

The project is a matching game.

A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

The game displays a star rating that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game. 

When the player starts a game, a displayed timer will also start.

Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

If the time exceeded 60 minutes, the game will be over.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
